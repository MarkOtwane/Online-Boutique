## üöÄ **How to Run the Full Application**

### 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

cd frontend
ng serve
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:4200`

## üîê **Authentication Flow**

3. **Deploy**: Both frontend and backend are ready for production deployment
4. **Customize**: Modify the API endpoints or add new features as needed

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure backend CORS is properly configured
2. **Token Issues**: Check if tokens are being sent in headers
3. **API Errors**: Verify backend endpoints are running correctly
